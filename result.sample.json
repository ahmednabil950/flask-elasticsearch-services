A little confusing getting there if your walking (very little to no street signs) but ultimately a call to the BB saved me from wondering around. Quiet neighborhood, bed was comfortable and bathroom was good considering that this is a very old building so keep that in mind. This is not the Marriot but it is a nice place to rest after a long day on a plane. The innkeeper (Byron) was very nice and helpful. I didn't stay for the breakfast opting for a bowl of cereal instead due to a busy schedule. Overall a good BB experience and I would definitely come back if I'm ever in the area. Thank you. A.G.",

The house is in a great spot, within walking distance of most of Harvard, and close to the Harvard T-station, so easy to get around.

Rooms were really nice, and the bed was very comfortable. Shared bathroom was always clean and tidy, and never busy/no waiting for the shower. A/C kept the room cool, temperature was never a problem.

One of the four rooms on the third floor is lived by a staff there, who is nice and helps you with luggage. There is only one bathroom on the third room, which is extremely inconvenient. Most of the time, you have to share the bathroom with other at least four people, take turns and often wait to use the bathroom. The furniture in the room is old with a rotten wood smell. You can smell it all the time. The kitchen looks very dirty. The staff will make the breakfast for you if you are willing to wait there, which can take pretty a long time. Though you can tell the staff when you prefer to have the breakfast, you will feel really embarrassed if you are the only one having the breakfast at the time. In addition, can you imagine a BB not offering orange juice for breakfast The worst part, the price is not cheaper than the other BB close by, which offers much better breakfast, service and room, and in which you do need to wait to use the bathroom. This BB in Cambridge has very thin wall, so you can always hear the noise from the busy street even at late night. In summary, I felt I lived in a hostel instead of a BB.",

                            "reviews.text": "I stayed in the BB in Cambridge from 9-14 August 2014 when I attended a course at Harvard. The biggest asset of this BB is the location: it is 10-min. walk to the Harvard Yard. The breakfast was also very good (crepes or flapjacks with blueberries), but could be more varied. Byron, the live-in manager was very helpful and entertaining. I booked this BB based on the very positive reviews, but the standard has obviously dropped since they were written. Having said that, the owners have been working on bringing it back to standard, especially the cleanliness. However, more work is needed to make it a competitive BB, suitable to the needs of business travellers or visitors to Harvard or MIT. It was also too expensive for what it offered (188 a night!) The bathroom is shared! If you are on a tight schedule you will need to book the shower. We had 5 people competing for the shower, but the biggest problem was the toilet (no guest WC). The back porch needs a lot of work before it can be enjoyed by the guests, but they do have a selection of books and Byron is a walking encyclopaedia of knowledge about Cambridge and Boston. Parking: you will need a lot of luck or a lot of patience! The apartment is on the third floor, so ask Byron for help with your luggage. Bottom line: Great location, and great potential. With honest work this can be a great place to stay for visitors to Harvard or MIT. I hope the owners will turn this BB around to deserve great reviews again.",

Carpet was old and dirty. Room service came one time and just made our beds with all that was in our bed such as cheerios and baby's toys. They did not change our towels or clean the bathroom. Water in the pool was cold. Lot of noise around the pool did not make our stay relaxing. They charged 220 per night. It is such a shame to rip off hard working American people just bc they wanted to celebrate their most important holiday July 4th. This room is not worth 30. Would not recomend this hotel to anyone.",

All 3 people were there to complain and to ask for their money back. There was 2 people wanting their money refunded due to bed bugs that they had found in their room and another asking for a refund because the hotel was unable to give them the accommodations that were promised. The man at front desk was very argumentative and rude. When it was our turn we immediately explained that we were a little nervous to stay based on what we just witnessed. His logic was we might as well stay here because he was not going to give our money back and in addition to that he was insisting that we pay him 20 in cash because our child is 15 and anyone over 14 must pay additional charge. I again explained that we was just worried about bed bugs and he said that it was fine because he had called exterminator and thus had done everything he could. He was unreasonable and rude. I left the lobby in tears. We decided to inspect the room and found items that had been left there from the previous customers all over the room. In my opinion anyone considering this hotel for your vacation should just keep looking.",

I'm used to staying in MUCH nicer hotels, but for a somewhat last minute trip and wanting to be close to the beach and center of town its what We settled for. The pool was decent and I think it was heated at night. The room was not the best, it was somewhere to sleep and put our stuff, is what it was. Nothing fancy or extra AT ALL. the sheets had a hole and they were not changed everyday. And there wasn't even an actual comforter on the bed. We had to febreeze it( it had a stale smell) and I wiped down the room myself when we got there.( for my own assurance) But we still stayed for 4 nights 5 days. We went to target,radio shack, a little grocery shopping and the mall (with Dave and busters) ect. and the furthest we ever drove was still less then 10 mins. And the beach and broad walk was a half a mile down the street. I personally would never choose to stay here again but it wasn't the worst either. Like I said it was somewhere to stay and so affordable (under our normal hotel budget) and location wise, it was great, we were in the middle of everything. We'll just say it wasn't nearly bad enough to get in the way of enjoying our vacation.",
